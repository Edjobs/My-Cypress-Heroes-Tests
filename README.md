# My real world app test

This is a project that utilizes cypress to create tests for the "Cypress heroes" app (https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-heroes/tree/main), in which you need to install that one before. 

It tests the app's login, transactions and seeing the transactions history's functions.

## Requirements

Need to install Cypress heroes and then copy my (this git's) cypress files into them.
